## General info
This app gives users the oportunity to read a litt about me, view my work through deeployed applications and my Github Repo, look at my resume, and contact me with any questions they may have.

## Installation
Steps required to install project:

- Clone the repo to your own system.
- Run npm install from the command line in the root directory
- Invoke the application with "npm start"

You may also just view the working deployment at the link in the Links section.

## Functionality
Currently this is a front-end only application with very basic functionality. You will begin on the About Me page, where you can read about me and view my profile picture. You can then click on the different options in the Navbar: Portfolio, Resume, and Contact. In the Portfolio, you can view screenshots of some projects I have done, and then click on the links to either visit the Github Repo or view the deployed application. In the Resume section, you can view some listed proficiencies, and also download a PDF of my resume. In the Contact section, you will EVENTUALLY be able to use the form to send me an email. (This is currently only a front-end app, though, so it doesn't work.) You can also view my email and use that to get in touch with me.
