                {`While everything went bonkers in 2020, it gave me the opportunity to step back and see where I wanted to be and what I wanted to do. I love learning. I love teaching. I love collaberating. It seems that the things I love all lead to Web Development. So here I am, fresh off a BootCamp and ready to apply my continuingly growing skills.

                As I have progressed through my career as an adult human, I have found that while all my past positions have been connected where one leads to the other, they have all been very different. Different in their duties; Different in their fields; Different in their environments. This diverse employment history has been a blessing and a curse. On one hand, I know a lot of things about a lot of things. On the other, however, it's been hard for me to decide how I want to proceed with my professional career moving forward.
                
                Enter Web Development.`}
